# Population Analysis of Major US Cities

This Python-based data visualization project aims to analyze and compare the population statistics of prominent cities across the United States. Leveraging the Matplotlib and Pandas libraries, the project provides an insightful visual representation of population data through an interactive bar chart.

## Features

- **Data Collection and Processing:** The project compiles population data for select US cities and organizes it into a structured format using the Pandas DataFrame.
  
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib is utilized to create a visually appealing bar chart showcasing the population distribution of major US cities. Each city is represented by a bar, with the length of the bar corresponding to its population size.

- **Customization:** Users can easily customize the project by substituting the provided sample data with their own dataset. Various chart properties such as colors, labels, and layout can be adjusted to meet specific requirements.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/population-analysis.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install matplotlib pandas
    ```

3. Replace the sample data in the `data` dictionary with your own dataset, if desired.

4. Run the Python script to generate the population analysis chart:

    ```bash
    python population_analysis.py
    ```

5. Explore the generated chart to gain insights into the population distribution of major US cities.
